# XR-for-education
## Extended Reality for enhancing student learning
The main aim of our AR/VR educational classroom app is to provide an accessible and easy-to-use learning experience for students of all levels. Our app is designed to be intuitive and engaging so that students can learn without being overwhelmed by the technology.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The current educational system in most countries is not very engaging for students. This is a major concern, as it can lead to poor learning outcomes. Technology has the potential to make learning more engaging and interactive. This can lead to improved learning outcomes. There are a number of ways that technology can be integrated into the classroom.

#  AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
Our main objectives are as follows: 
Provide students with the option to learn through augmented reality or virtual reality.
Create an interactive classroom environment where students can toggle between AR and VR.
Develop an AR application that allows students to interact with 3D objects that are relevant to the markers.
Provide custom markers that are associated with their relevant 3D object and can be used for interaction and engagement.
Create student interaction with the 3D models that are designed, animated, and linked with their markers.
Spawn the models that are also provided with features to zoom and rotate.
Display relevant information about the model after the marker/image is processed.
Help students understand complex concepts by visualizing them.
Project different dimensions of the objects that are created in the three-dimensional environment.
Provide interactive simulations and exercises that allow students to apply what they have learned more engagingly.
Provide an adaptive VR environment for students with impairments, as it can give them a chance to experience out-of-reach situations and can also be very practical in the everyday education process.
Reimagine and redefine the VR classroom by creating effective and innovative solutions that reflect the needs of the contemporary classroom.
Deploy AR/VR to optimize learning outcomes through the use of simulation, 3D imagery, and advanced audio-visual effects.
